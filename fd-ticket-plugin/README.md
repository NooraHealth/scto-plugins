  {: .warning }
  **Note**: Ensure the file name doesn't contain any trailing numbers like `(1)`, `(2)` which are automatically added by your system if you already have the plugin downloaded. Remove these and ensure the file name follows the format: `fd-ticket.fieldplugin.zip`

### 5. Update Configuration for Production

{: .important }
**Note**: Before using this form in `production`, you must update the following values in the sample form:

- **`apiUrl`** and **`apiToken`**: Contact Abhishek to obtain the correct API credentials for your environment
- **`projectId`**: Update this value to match your specific project requirements

These values are currently set to placeholder/default values in the test form and need to be configured properly for the plugin to function correctly in production.
