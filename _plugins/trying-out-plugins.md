# Trying Out the Plugins

If you want to try out any of the plugins, here are the common steps you need to perform:

## 1. Download the Test Form

Download the test form from the `extras/test-form/` directory in the respective plugin repository. Test forms are included with every plugin and are mentioned in their respective documentation.

## 2. Upload the Test Form to SurveyCTO

Follow the guide at [Working with spreadsheet form definitions](https://support.surveycto.com/hc/en-us/articles/4613295552275-Working-with-spreadsheet-form-definitions-1-Creating-and-uploading#2) to upload the test form to your SurveyCTO server.

## 3. Download and Upload the Plugin

- Download the plugin file from the download link in the respective plugin documentation

  {: .warning }
  **Note**: Ensure the file name doesn't contain any trailing numbers like `(1)`, `(2)` which are automatically added by your system if you already have the plugin downloaded. Remove these and ensure the file name follows the correct format.

- Follow the guide at [Using field plug-ins](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/03-advanced-topics/06.using-field-plug-ins.html) to attach the plugin as an attachment to your form
